This personal portfolio project is a web-based showcase of my work, skills, and educational background. Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, the portfolio highlights my projects, academic qualifications, and technical skills. It also includes a contact form for easy communication. To access the portfolio, clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. Future updates will focus on responsive design improvements and the addition of new projects.
